TLDR of importants part (for this project).

Page 82 part b:
'[...] If the interval of time
between two hits is less than 40 ms (1/25th of a second), the apparatus must register a
double hit (both signal lamps must light up simultaneously). When the interval is
greater than 50 ms (1/20 of a second) the apparatus must register only one hit (only
one signal lamp is lit). The tolerance allowed for timing the apparatus is that between
these two limits (1/25th and 1/20th of a second)'

-> So the time for a double hit must be somewhere beetween 0 and 50 ms,
I set the threshold to 50 ms because nrf24l01 messages can be quite slow sometimes.

---

Page 82 part c:
'[...] The apparatus must not register signals of less than 2 ms duration.'

-> So if a hit occure i must check it last more than 2 ms before sending a hit message

---

Page 84 part a number 3:
'The audible signal will consist of either one short ring or a continuous note lasting
1â€“2 seconds, simultaneous with the light signals. The sound will be the same for
both sides of the apparatus'

-> I choosed to make it last 2 seconds to make it easier to see
