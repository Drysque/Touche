# PCB

This directory contains the PCB files and the Gerbers for the 2 boxes.

I ordered all my PCB at [jlcpcb](https://jlcpcb.com/) and they always came up perfectly so i would recommend it. (No sponsorship or anything from jlcpcb I'm just a satisfied customer sharring his experience).



## If you're not familiar with PCB making

Upload the gerber files on jlcpcb (or any competitor),  leave all the settings at default and order.

Be aware that you can't order less than 5 (at least on jlcpcb I dind't check anywhere else).

Order **client and server** pcb in the **same order** to save time and money.

[Many tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=order+pcb+) exist on youtube to show how to order pcbs online so watch one if you want more informations.

To give you an idea of the price and waiting time I pay 20$ for the client and server pcb (each in 5) with delivery and they arrive in 10-14 days (I live in France).




## If you're familiar with PCB making

I designed these PCB with Eagle (because I have an Education licence for Eagle).

The Arduino nano and NRF24L01 parts come from here : https://www.diymodules.org/

I learned PCB making with this project so they may not be perfect (but they work well).

Please open an issue if you spot any design error.
