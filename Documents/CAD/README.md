# CAD

This directory contains the 3D stl files for the 2 boxes.



## Print settings

All parts are printed with **0.2 layer height** and **20% infill**. 

I printed them all on my ender 3 pro so I don't think any of them can be considered as a difficult print.

You'll need supports for the **client base** and **both lids**.

I recommend printing both lids **upside down** (that's why you'll need supports for the screw holes)

I sliced all files using Cura.



## Print time

This is just to give you an idea of the print time I had on my **ender 3 pro** at **50 mm/s** (and most of Cura's defaults settings)

| Part        | Time   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Client base | 6 h 31 |
| Client lid  |        |
| Server base |        |
| Server lid  |        |
